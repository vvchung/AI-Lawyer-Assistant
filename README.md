## 🕯️ A Letter to You: Far From Home, With Limited Resources

Hello.

Perhaps you are staring at this screen right now, your heart filled with anxiety and helplessness.

Maybe your landlord is withholding the deposit you saved so hard for, leaving you unsure how to pay for next month's living expenses.
Maybe your employer is exploiting the fact that you are a student—delaying your wages, or even threatening to fire you if you complain.
Or perhaps, it's a terrifying legal document or contract in a language you don't fully understand, keeping you awake at night, wondering if you've done something wrong.

You know lawyers are expensive. A single hour of consultation might cost half your monthly budget. You feel scared. In this unfamiliar legal system, you might feel small and insignificant, perhaps even thinking: *"Forget it, I'll just pay to make this go away..."*

**Please do not give up. Please do not be afraid. This project exists specifically to protect you.**

Inspired by the healing spirit of **[HuatuoGPT-II, One-stage Training for Medical Adaption of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09774)**, we deeply believe: **The advancement of technology should be used to bridge the gap created by wealth, not widen it.**

This is not just a cold program; it is a **Digital Guardian** prepared for you. It charges no fees, it never sleeps, and it does not judge your background. It is always ready to listen to your grievances and hand you a sword to defend your dignity.
